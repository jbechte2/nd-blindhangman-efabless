Developed to demonstrate open source flow using the GF 180 flow using EFabless to students in my CSE 30342 Digital Integrated Circuits course.

The user_proj_example.v file contains a description of an 8-bit MIPS microprocessor with a datapath with a controller, and memory elements.

The tutorials for setting up this flow (with some limitations for introductoty CSE 30342 student)

1) Setting up the EFabless Environment - https://github.com/mmorri22/cse30342/blob/main/Resources/Final%20Project%20-%20Setup.ipynb

2) Running through the Project, including how to map the Verilog to user_proj_example.v, and how to map the user_proj_example module to the user_project_wrapper. Finally, the student learns how to push the project to the EFabless GitHub repository, and how to perform MPW and Tapeout Checks - https://github.com/mmorri22/cse30342/blob/main/Resources/Final%20Project%20-%20Implementation.ipynb
