Developed as a final project for the University of Notre Dame's Digital Integrated Circuits class. This project is a blind hangman game. The game has ROM with 64 five letter words, which the user can select using input pins. The user inputs up to seven letters, one at a time. If the letter guessed is correct, the output pin corresponding to the letter in the word will turn on.
